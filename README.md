## **Image-Segmentation-Using-Random-Walker**

    1. Random_Walker.ipynb contains the code for the Random-Walker algorithm.
    2. Dataset folder contains the images on which image segmentation has been tried on. To use another dataset, simply mount your Google Drive, write it's path in the "Path" variable and run all cells.
    2. Effective comparison has been shown between our Random_walker fucntion and Scikit-Learn implementation of Random Walker.
    3. To run the code simply run all the cells in the notebook.
